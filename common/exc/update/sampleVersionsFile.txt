# ExtraneousCraft Versions

# NOTE: If you want letters in your versions, you MUST replace references to fenceFoil's VersionCompare with either your own or use Forge's somehow.
# As an alternative, you can substitute ".00" for a, ".01" for b, and increment 0.01 to 0.02 for releases. Not perfect, but it'll pass the day.
mod.latest.mc.1.4.6 = 0.01.00 

# Not used unless you want to download new versions
# Please be considerate of those who don't like mods downloading new versions "secretly:" do not automatically download new versions without permission.
