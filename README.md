## ExtraneousCraft 0.02alpha
**OFFICIAL RELEASE**: [ExtraneousCraft 0.02alpha_2 for Minecraft 1.5.1] (http://www.mediafire.com/?v6rcsb1d6dv9f16)

***

ExtraneousCraft is a mod all about Alien Beings that have already learned to alter with physics of Time and Space. And it seems like they've already visited the overworld and Nether of ours they left Dungeons and Ancient Chambers of Knowledge for us to find and with help of their leftovers, humankind is able to do further research by the means of being able to alter the reality that lies deep within the attributes of Time and Space. By learning by studying the ways of these beings we're able to harness a power called Void Energy which is the highest tier of energy that is created trough the Space itself and used by the Extraneous(Alienic) Beings. By gathering and researching/studying this kind of energy humankind have learned ways to Craft their way trough the machines of the Extraneous and implement and use these in their daily routine such as mining/farming and processing ores.As the research goes on humans have discovered new ways to harness the Void Energy that exists in the Void where it is in it's most condensed and powerful form and not just use their enviromental energy to run their Energy craving machines. As the research continues finally we're able to gather "Attributes" out of materials that are founded troughout the Overworld, The Nether and The End; Decompose them to their essence as Molecules and Re-Compose them to other Materials that can be converted like Carbon Molecules in a stack of coal is equal to the Carbon density/molecules of 1 Diamond. As the Alienic Research and Evolution of Machines goes on and on humans wonder what they can do now. This mod is all about Alienic Research Time and Space that is all i can tell for you now as in mod Version 0.01alpha

Void Energy(vE):
----------------
Energy used troughout the mod created by Extraneous beings that live in a galaxy far far away from ours. It is the most concentrated and condensed form of energy that has been ever known to man therefore one unit of vE equals to 20 units of IndustrialCraft EU and 10 units of BuildCraft MJ. Void Energy also exists in our world(The Overworld) and also in the Nether but very small amounts and it must be refined before it can be used Earlier in the game this method could be easier for processing ores and such but later on to gather the energy out of the Void itself will be much much powerful, complicated and more efficent.There are pretty complicated ways that a person can accumulate and use this type of energy like gathering the energy of "Void Lights" only avaible during night(Void Lights can spawn near or further away according to the researches of the Extraneous Beings accumulating it will be random, gathering a patch of VL can take 1 to 3 Minecraft Nights.); Eternal Alternator is another way to accumulate this type of energy basically takes materials to amplify it's gathering rate of vE. Void Concentrator can also be used to gather  Void particles that spawn in the lowest points of overworld and concentrate it to Void Energy.Has 4 Considered subtypes. **RAW** is the raw form of the energy it can be used byt much like Buildcraft oil it must be refined before it can be used properly. **CONCENTRATED** is the fluid form of this energy it can be stored in tanks and can be refined again to make a fuel of high quality. **CONDENSED** form is what you gain from running void energy condensers it accepts liquid form of vE and condenses it to a higher quality to be properly used in machines. **NOVA** is not a form of energy that you can get by just refining one can only obtain nova quality void energy from harnessing rare Nova explosions that occur in outer Void a machine that can harness that power will be added in next few versions of ExtraneousCraft.

Herbal Accumulator (+Added in 0.01alpha)
-----------------------------------------
You invented a way to safely accumulate herbal stuff like Saplings, vines or seeds, it seems fairly weak but maybe there is some way to reinforce it.

Void Heliograph:   
----------------
You've been blessed with the tiniest amount of alienic research for creating this machine it'll be an essential to Craft different machines throughout your adventures of altering Space&Time. This is a machine that can use Void Energy to energize itself to combine different materials into one.

Void Concentrator:
------------------
Your own mind and research of the complicated ways of Alien Beings and Void Energy has finally gave it's fruits. You now can gather a bit of void energy that is hidden and spread troughout YOUR world. Can be Placed on Bedrock to gather and concentrate Void Particles into vE.

Void Charging Station: 
----------------------
More in-depth studies of vE and Space gives you a way to unlock the hidden potential of all materials that has been ever known to mankind however doing this uses significant amounts of vE and over-extending a tool's capacity can be very dangerous that if you try loading much more enery that a tool can handle it'll have a chance of breaking or even Exploding Randomly. Uses Void energy to Restore/Repair Stuff...(Can be used to Overcharge Tools/Overcharging = 3times Efficiency/5times Durability cannot be repaired)

Eternal Alternator: 
-------------------
Finally a way to gather huge, significant amounts of vE is revealed upon you but be aware of this method will alter the nature around it simply because the world that we know can not possibly handle that kind of vE you'll quickly have to store it or when it's internal buffer is full vE will leak and cause bad things to happen like Lightnings striking on living things in the area. Luckily further in your research you've founded a way to stop this madness simply apply a Redstone signal to stop this machine from functioning. It may need some materials to amplify itself and condense the gathered vE to Energy that can be stored. Gathers Energy from outer Space using selected materials(Scrap from IC2 will be avaiable) to amplify it's gathering rate.

Molecular Decomposer:
---------------------
Wow this machine can decompose items or ores into it's very essence it is Blazing fast and it uses the minimum amount a Void Machine can ever use so you can even run it off of the minor vE you have been gathering from the enviroment around you or the Void Particles .Can process ores into Molecule Chunks, Cool and extra-ordinary way of processing your ores into 2 or sometimes maybe even 3 ingots.(Mod support included!)(Uses the Void energy.)

Molecular Composer: 
-------------------
An alien machine that can compose materials' molecules and create different materials like "3 copper Atoms + 1 Tin Atom = 2 Bronze Molecule(These Materials are only Valid if a mod that adds these to forge oreDictionary is installed/loaded and valid)"1 Carbon Atom + 8 Iron Atoms = 4 Reinforced Iron Molecule"

Molecular Replicator:
---------------------
A cloning machine i'm Rich!!! Well not really it can only replicate molecules until they form a piece of matter like an ingot. It can Replicate stuff but it takes massive amounts of energy to do that a diamond in the Replicator can cost you 10000s of vE and yes that is a huge amount even creating diamond from coal in IC2 costs less. Once you have 1 kind of molecule you can replicate it until it becomes an ingot (or another material) using this machine operates in 5ticks(0.25th of a second)1vE per Tick

Molecule Cell:
--------------
Can Store one Molecule to be used in the replicator if a molecule chunk is storend in this and isolated from enviromental issues you can get 3ingots out of one molecule chunk. 4 iron ingots and 1 glass pane in the Heliograph is required to craft 4 Molecule Cells.

Void Matter Assembler:
----------------------
Aren't you just tired of Ordinary Crafting ok now we've got you covered craft your stuff in this big-arse crafting bench that uses your precious Void Energy Units to assemble your Not-So-Raw materials. It has a very slightly chance of fail but don't worry it won't swallow up your items it'll assemble them as a "Failed Molecule Chunk" and you'll be able to use the Decomposer to get the materials back again .A 5x5 Crafting table that can use vE to craft Later-In-Game stuff.

Molecular Storage Unit:
-----------------------
Can only store Moleculized materials. 10000s of them!!!
Eterneous Materials: A possible by-product of processing Void Materials. Sometimes a material that cannot be broken or disingenerated can be infused to high quality Extraneous materials and become a by-product of this material. Processing and shaping this material gives you Eterneous Material as in Ingots(Eterneous Ingots) They seem to possess the power of Space&Emptyness within. Therefore it's eternal it can be expanded or dispanded but it cannot disappear by any means. Tools crafted from this material break into Eternal Fragments That can be re-processed into Eterneous Ingots.This is the "Space" type of Material therefore it's attributes are "Emptyness", "Space", "Void", "Unbreaking", "Eternal" There are several types and attributes of materials in the universe. This material's ingots can be used to craft Tools and needed to craft some of the later on "Space" related machines. It seems to contain emptyness it can be used to upgrade one's chests to have more space (or can be used in place of Dark Iron to create barrel upgrades and WrathLamps if Factorization is installed)

Energy Catalyst: 
---------------
A crystal of condensed energy requires a mighty "Nether Star" / 4 diamonds and 4 glass to craft. yeah storing Void Energy in matter can be expensive but it seems like the attributes a Nether Star possesses is capable of storing a little of this highly explosive compressed energy. Can Store 1000 vE

Reinforced Catalyst:
--------------------
So you've gone mad with power and Reinforced your Energy Catalyst with 4 more Nether Stars, 2 Reinforced Iron Plating and 2 more Diamonds as Capacitors. Your handheld Void Energy Storage Catalyst (VESC for short) now can store over 9000!!!(Vegeta FTW) Void Energy Units. Can Store 10000 vE

Void Catalyst:
--------------
Okay now that is what i call insane the latest "Extraneous" way of storing vE on the go! a Void Catalyst being the densest version of VESCs it is allowed to store around a 100.000 Void Energy Units you'll need the Void Matter Assembler to craft this Item. Can Store 100000 vE

Void Extractor:
---------------
Using the "Infinite" attribute of Space related machines you've found a way to expand and finally extract your raw materials uses only a little vE and can be obtained early in game. The Void Extractor can be used in ways such getting 2 buckets of Water from an Ice block getting lava from Netherrack and getting "Luminous Fluid" from glowstone or Glowstone Dust. Can extract items into other items.

Infernal Incinerator:
---------------------
Furnace that uses vE.(MultiBlock Considration)

Herbal Accumulator (+Added in 0.01alpha)
-----------------------------------------
You invented a way to safely accumulate herbal stuff like Saplings, vines or seeds, it seems fairly weak but maybe there is some way to reinforce it.
